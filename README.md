## Kata-filter_list

##### Code for the kata: filter_list

Takes a list as an argument.  
Should remove all non-integer elements from the list (such as strings, characters).  
Return a list of only integer elements.

##### Problem with code:

Removes the first non-integer element and then leaves the for-loop that loops over the elements in the list
